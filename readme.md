# URL-TO-BIBTEX

```sh
nix run github:jjjholscher/url-to-bibtex urls.txt
```

where `urls.txt` looks like
```
https://url1.com/whatever
https://url2.net/urls-are-separated-by-newline
```

and you'll get a bibtex file printed to stdout.
orr maybe you're reading this after I made some edits but didn't update the readme, in which case... whatever just try and see!
